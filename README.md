# Sublinks Federation

Federation service for Sublinks

## Local Dev

I use [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) to develop "locally". However, you can also just use VS Code and the included devcontainer config should provide the same environment/workflow.

### Run

- Copy .env-sample to .env
- Replace values in .env file
- Source .env file: `source .env`
- Run `go run ./cmd/`
- Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)
